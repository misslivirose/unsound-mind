# Unsound Mind Projects

I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I created this repository. I knew I wanted a place for my more ethereal emotions to settle; a place where I could express my anger with "the system" and my frustrations with a world that I helped create. A place where I could be optimistic and yearn for something better, a place where I could be a more raw, authentic, and vulnerable version of myself after years of keeping my innermost thoughts locked away from even my own mind. A place that allowed blog posts and essays, but also poetry and other projects that haven't made themselves known to me yet.  

Not anymore. 

### Essays of an Unsound Mind
Essays of an Unsound Mind is a series that explores the philosophy of technology through an existential and occasionally psychological lens. It is where I share the ideas that are in some ways most core to my values and beliefs, and in other ways completely unformed. Right now, those thoughts are framed around the metaverse and creating shared digital worlds, most often as a way of my brain building a framework through which to think about the relationship between self, community, and environment. 

### Astoria: a reinvention of self through the illusion of love
Astoria is an upcoming collection of poetry that serves as a journal of self-discovery through a brief but intense, challenging, and confusing relationship. A limited run of print copies will be available in Q1 2022.
